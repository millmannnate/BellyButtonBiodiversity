# BellyButtonBiodiversity
This project uses javascript, plotly, D3.js, and html to display data about bacteria in the human belly button. Using the tools from the plotly library, we created charts and graphs on our dashboard. The dashboard was interactive using a dropdown menu to switch between the test subjects' and display the relative charts on graphs on the dashboard.
